<p>This is my humble website. As you can see it is quite empty.</p>
```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;

<p>I hope to add some examples of additional projects soon. </p>
<p>If you're on mobile, I apologize.</p>
<p> This is a test to make sure my setup is working as of 08/08/2022.</p>
